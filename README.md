# Heart Disease Classification

This project uses the **Heart Disease dataset** to build and evaluate classification models. The main goal is to compare the performance of a **Decision Tree Classifier** and a **Random Forest Classifier**.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is [`heart.csv`](./heart.csv), originally sourced from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Heart Disease Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)

It contains various medical attributes and a binary target indicating the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of heart disease.

## 📌 Objectives

1. Train a **Decision Tree Classifier** and visualize the tree.
2. Analyze **overfitting** and control tree depth using accuracy curves.
3. Train a **Random Forest Classifier** and compare its performance.
4. Interpret and plot **feature importances**.
5. Evaluate models using **cross-validation**.
